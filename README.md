# About my project 
This Java Swing application provides a basic, functional diary program for users to record their thoughts and experiences.  It features a login system (with predefined credentials for simplicity), a text area for composing diary entries, and a mechanism for saving these entries.  Entries can be saved both within the application's memory (for viewing in the current session) and persistently to a text file on the user's system.  The application utilizes a card layout to switch between different panels, providing a clean user interface.  Users can navigate between the login screen, the diary entry screen, and a screen displaying their saved entries.  The saved entries screen presents the entries in a list format, allowing users to select and delete specific entries.  The project demonstrates fundamental Java Swing concepts such as GUI component creation (JFrames, JPanels, JLabels, JTextFields, JTextAreas, JButtons, JLists), layout management (CardLayout, BorderLayout, GridLayout), event handling (ActionListeners), basic file input/output operations (FileWriter, JFileChooser), and data storage using ArrayLists.  It's a good example for learning basic GUI development and data management in Java.
